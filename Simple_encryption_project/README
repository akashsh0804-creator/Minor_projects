🔐 Simple Text Encryption & Decryption Tool (Python)

This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that performs simple text encryption and decryption using a randomized substitution cipher.
Every character typed by the user is replaced with a different character based on a shuffled key, making the encrypted message unreadable without the key.

This tool demonstrates:

Character mapping

Basic cryptography concepts

User interaction

Randomized key generation

✨ Features
🔑 Random Key Generation

The program builds a list of characters including:

spaces

punctuation

digits

lowercase + uppercase letters

A shuffled version of this list acts as the cipher key

🔐 Encryption

Takes user input (plain text)

Replaces each character with its mapped pair from the key

Produces encrypted text that cannot be manually reversed without the key

🔓 Decryption

Takes encrypted text as input

Uses the key to map each encrypted character back to its original character

Outputs the decrypted (plain) text

🧭 Interactive Menu

The user can choose:

Encrypt text

Decrypt text

Quit

▶️ How to Use

Run the script:

python encryption_tool.py


Sample menu:

***** This is a simple encryption tool *****
What do you wish to do?
1. Encryption of a text
2. Decryption of the text
3. Quit the program
Enter an option(1,2 or 3):


Example encryption:

Your Normal text was    : hello!
Your Encrypted text is  : 4@Zm#


Example decryption:

Your Encrypted text was : 4@Zm#
Your Decrypted text is  : hello!

🧠 How It Works

A character set is created (letters + digits + punctuation + space)

A shuffled copy acts as the encryption key

Encryption:
plain_text[i] → key[index]

Decryption:
cipher_text[i] → chars[index]

User interacts through a simple looped menu

⚠ Note: Since the key is generated at runtime, encrypted text can only be decrypted within the same session.
If the program is restarted, a new key is created, making old encrypted messages unreadable.
