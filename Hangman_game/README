🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

A simple and fun Hangman game built in Python!
The player must guess a hidden word (animal names in this version) before the hangman drawing is completed. Each wrong guess brings the player one step closer to losing!

This project uses:

Random word selection

ASCII art for the hangman

Input validation

Game loop with win/lose detection

✨ Features
🔤 Random Word Generator

The game randomly selects a word from a list of animal names stored in wordslist.py.

🎨 ASCII Hangman Art

The player sees the hangman progressively drawn after each wrong guess.

✔ Input Validation

Only single alphabet letters allowed

Repeated guesses are blocked

🏆 Win/Lose Conditions

Win: all letters are guessed

Lose: 6 wrong guesses (full hangman)

🧠 How It Works

The game picks a random word.

A hint of underscores (_ _ _) is displayed.

The player guesses letters one by one.

Correct guesses fill in the hint.

Wrong guesses draw more of the hangman.

Game ends when:

The word is fully revealed → You Win

The hangman is complete → You Lose

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.x

📌 Notes

The word list includes 100+ animal names.

The code uses sets to track guessed letters.

ASCII art is stored in a dictionary for easy modification.
