💳 Credit Card Validator & Classifier

This project is a simple Python program that validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm and also classifies the card type based on standard industry identifiers.
It supports American Express, Mastercard, and VISA card detection.

📌 Features
✅ Credit Card Classification

The program identifies the card type based on:

American Express → 15 digits, starts with 34 or 37

Mastercard → 16 digits, starts with 51–55

VISA → 13 or 16 digits, starts with 4

✅ Validation Using Luhn Algorithm

The program checks whether the entered credit card number is valid by:

Reversing the card number

Doubling every second digit

Summing digits properly

Verifying if the final total ends in 0

🧠 How It Works

User enters a credit card number (with or without spaces/dashes).

Program cleans the input (removes - and spaces).

The card type is determined from length and prefix.

The number is validated using the Luhn checksum algorithm.

Final result: Valid or Invalid.

▶️ Usage

Run the script:

python credit_card_validator.py


Enter a credit card number when prompted:

Enter a credit card no.: 4111 1111 1111 1111


Output example:

4111 1111 1111 1111 is a VISA card
Credit card # 4111 1111 1111 1111 is Valid!
